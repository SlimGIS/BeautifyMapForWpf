In the [previous thread](https://github.com/SlimGIS/QuickstartSampleForWPF), we guided you to walk through a simple quick start sample of SlimGIS MapKit for WPF. In this thread, we will show you how to build a beautify map. Here is a preview of our samples.

In the basic sample, we will show you 3 kinds of theme.

We can also adjust the predefine theme by css, then we click the "Apply Changes" button to see our changes. It's pretty cool. Do you think so?
